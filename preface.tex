\section*{About this book}

This little book of C is based on the "Essential C" document written by Nick Parlante at Stanford University.  The Essential C document was last updated in 2003, which is one reason why this document exists.  Programming languages and compilers change, and I wanted to take the good work that Nick had done and make several updates. The original document is available at \url{http://cslibrary.stanford.edu/101/}.  The notice reproduced below is copied from Essential C:
