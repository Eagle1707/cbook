A head-first dive into C
************************

In this first chapter, we take a plunge into C by way of a tutorial that examines a variety of topics that are discussed in depth in later chapters.  

.. literalinclude:: code/hello.c
   :language: c
   :linenos:

.. todo::

    * simple hello, world program
    * show compiler output and using the compiler

      * show compiler error stuff
      * show both gcc and clang

    * dog years program, with strtol (or atoi); do with both int and float division
    * simple discussion of string arrays; nul character termination
    * say that most operators are the same as in Python and Java; (no ** in C)
    * exercises

      * how long till we get there program
      * race pace calculator
      * take a HH:MM:SS string and return number of seconds (hard, at this point)
